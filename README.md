# webperformancenews.com

A simple, static site generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) which displays the latest news in Web Performance from around the web.

The newsletter is curated by me, [Andy Shora](http://twitter.com/andyshora)

## Deployment

The site is generated via Github's Jekyll support. Pushing code to the `gh-pages` branch will envoke a build and deployment.
